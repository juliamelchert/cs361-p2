# Project 2: Nondeterministic Finite Automata

* Authors: Julia Melchert and Axel Murillo
* Class: CS361 Section 002
* Semester: Spring 2024

## Overview

This project uses Java to mimic a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA).

## Reflection

Write a brief (2-3 paragraph) reflection describing your experience with this 
project. Answer the following questions (but feel free to add other insights): 
* What worked well and what was a struggle?

* What concepts still aren't quite clear?

* What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?

* What would you change about your design process?

* If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?


## Compiling and Using

In order to compile and run the test suite, use the following commands:
```
javac -cp .:/usr/share/java/junit.jar ./test/nfa/NFATest.java
java -cp .:/usr/share/java/junit.jar:/usr/share/java/hamcrest/core.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore test.nfa.NFATest
```

If you want to make an NFA of your own, follow the structure of NFATest.java to import all the appropriate packages/libraries and initialize the NFA object correctly.
